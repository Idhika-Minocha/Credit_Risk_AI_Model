**Credit Risk Prediction Models**

This repository contains two models aimed at assessing credit risk: a Deep Learning model and a Machine Learning model. Both models predict credit risk levels based on historical financial and demographic data.
- Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a multi-layered neural network for complex pattern recognition in credit data, providing a high-accuracy credit risk classification.
- Machine Learning Model: Implements traditional algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to deliver a robust baseline for credit risk assessment.

Each model includes data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and thorough evaluation to ensure reliable predictions.
